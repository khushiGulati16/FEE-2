        Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates 
        led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, 
        but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, 
        which were considered anti-competitive. In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates 
        Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in 
        February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions 
        at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.
